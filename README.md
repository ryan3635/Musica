Musica is an album list web application for avid music fans to easily display and bookkeep their favorite albums.

While searching for albums, the album artwork is shown and displays information such as artist info, year, tracklist, and so on.

Users are able to create accounts via email & password login, or through Google. Password reset functionality has been implemented, along with changing displayname/email/password.

Album searching requires user input of album information. Once entered, the album page is displayed and the user can then add the album to their list.
Users can view their own list, along with maintaining it such as re-ordering albums, or removing them.
Once a list becomes long enough, extra page navigation tools are shown to help navigate larger lists.

Let your inner music nerd shine on Musica!
